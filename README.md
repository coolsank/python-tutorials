### Computational Social Science in Python


This is my list of Python tutorials and annoted analyses. I've tried to list the pages that are accessible to social scientists with little background in Python and/or machine learning. It emphasizes the package that I've found most useful, such as Pandas and scikit-learn learn. Many are IPython Notebooks, so they can be downloaded and run locally.


__Getting Set Up__

* [An Introduction to scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2014/blob/master/notebooks/00_Preliminaries.ipynb) by [Jake Vanderplas](http://www.vanderplas.com/)


__Entire Analysis__
One of the great things about IPython Notebooks is that you can present code and context in the same document.
