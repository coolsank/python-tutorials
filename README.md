### Computational Social Science in Python


This is my list of Python tutorials and annoted analyses. I've tried to list the pages that are accessible to social scientists with little background in Python and/or machine learning. It emphasizes the package that I've found most useful, such as Pandas and scikit-learn learn. Many are IPython Notebooks, so they can be downloaded and run locally.

__Model/Feature Selection__

Picking which model or variables to use often happens offstage in social science research. It doesn't have to be that way, though.

__Networks__

[NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) and [igraph](http://igraph.sourceforge.net) are both fairly powerful tools for network analysis. I don't think you can use them for regression analysis, but  you can use them to do things like compute centrality measures and make pretty pictures. You can also use Python to create/manipulate your network data for analysis/display elsewhere.

__Plotting__

[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is the default plotting library for data scientists and plays well with pandas. [seaborn](http://www.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) makes it prettier. Other programs, like [mpld3](http://mpld3.github.io), [Plotly](https://plot.ly), [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org), or [Vincent](http://vincent.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) are also worth trying out, especially for putting stuff together on the web.
